# Interactive Recommendation System with Word Embeddings using Word2Vec, Plotly, and NetworkX

### Itroduction
This is a practical part of the Coursera Guided Project created by the Coursera Project Network.


### Overview
We will be using a recipe dataset, to train a model to learn the interactions between different kind of ingredients and available products in a supermarket. This model can then be implemented in a number of different ways, for example,
- to recommend products based on items added to cart;
- to offer alternatives products based on stock;
- to discover new products to create different recipes.

### Objectives
In this project, we are going to focus on three learning objectives:

- How to preprocess and prepare a text dataset comprising recipes.
- How to train and use a Word2Vec model using Gensim.
- How to effectively visualize and evaluate a trained model in an interactive graph network using NetworkX and Plotly.


### Data

This is the [dataset](https://eightportions.com/datasets/Recipes/#fn:1). It is collated by Ryan Lee, sourced from [Food Network](https://www.foodnetwork.com/), [Epicurious](https://www.epicurious.com/), and [Allrecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/).
